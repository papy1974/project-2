# Installation
Run `npm i` to install the following dependencies:
* bcryptjs
* eslint-cli
* express
* express-handlebars
* express-session
* ibm-watson
* mysql
* mysql2
* nodemon
* passport
* passport-local
* sequelize

For the database, look in the DB directory for `db/schema.sql`. Use this schema to create a `vocabulary_db` database. [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) will create three tables in this database.

## Usage
Launch the app with either `node server.js` or `npm run watch`. The second command will launch the app with a nodemon, which restarts the server after changes to a file are saved. 


## Testing
This project uses Google's [eslint configuration](https://github.com/google/eslint-config-google) and [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/).
